# ActiveLA
 CS35L Fall 2022 Project

# WIP. Not everything is set up yet. Let us know if something does not work.

## Development setup
It's probably easier to do these on Github desktop.
But on command line:
Clone the repository and install required packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/TayKaiJun/Swee.git
...
cd server
npm install
cd ..
cd client
npm install
```
Use the following command to run the app on your local machine:
```
cd client
npm run dev
```
Invoking the dev script should run both the server and client
